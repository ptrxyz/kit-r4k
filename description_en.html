                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT - Research Data Repository for KIT - is an interdisciplinary
                    research data repository for archiving and publishing research data from
                    scientific studies and projects of KIT researchers. In RADAR4KIT,
                    research data is understood as digital data generated in the research
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT stores research data in the form of data sets, which may
                    consist of one or more files. These contain the actual research data as
                    well as descriptive metadata. In the following, such a compilation is
                    referred to as a "data package".
                </p>
                <h2>Operator</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT is offered by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
                    ("<b>Operator</b>") and is based on the
                    <a href="https://www.radar-service.eu/">RADAR</a> service offered by FIZ Karlsruhe. Data is stored
                    exclusively on the IT
                    infrastructure at the <a href"https://www.scc.kit.edu/">Steinbuch Centre for Computing
                        (SCC)</a>
                    of KIT. The service is primarily aimed at KIT researchers ("<b>
                        data
                        providers
                    </b>") who want to archive or publish their data. In RADAR4KIT,
                    data can be made accessible to third parties ("<b>data users</b>") or published on the Internet.
                </p>
                <h2>Registration and User Profiles</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT is an online service and can only be used via the Internet.
                    All KIT researchers can register with RADAR4KIT via their KIT account
                    (Shibboleth). In addition, in special cases, further accounts can be
                    created for KIT external users.
                </p>
                <h2>Roles and Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    The <b>administrators</b> can set up separate work areas for
                    different user groups (e.g. research groups, projects, institutes).
                    Subsequently, the administrator can provide additional users registered
                    with RADAR4KIT with rights as data providers for one or more of these
                    workspaces via the online service ("<b>Curator</b>"). Usually
                    the administrator will designate staff members of his own institution as
                    curators; however, if necessary, he can also authorize persons from
                    outside the institution. In RADAR4KIT, curators can upload, edit,
                    archive and, if necessary, publish research data exclusively in the
                    workspaces designated for them by the administrator. Curators designated
                    by the administrator can authorize other users registered with RADAR4KIT
                    as subcurators for their workspace. Subcurators are also data providers,
                    but do not have the possibility to archive or publish data packages or
                    to appoint other users as subcurators.
                </p>
                <h2>Services</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT can be used via a web-based user interface with current web
                    browsers or via a REST-based programming interface (API). The data
                    transmitter can create data packages within the workspace assigned to it
                    and assign individual files or ZIP files with several contained files to
                    them, which it transfers to RADAR4KIT via the Internet. He can add or
                    delete individual data via the user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data provider can describe data packages with metadata. The service
                    provides a form for this purpose on the RADAR4KIT platform.
                    Alternatively, the metadata can be created offline as an XML file and
                    then uploaded to the RADAR4KIT platform. The RADAR4KIT platform allows
                    data providers to download a template for a corresponding XML file as
                    well as an XML schema for validating the metadata in the latest version.
                    The administrator also has the possibility to define default values for
                    descriptive metadata for workspaces. These default values are then
                    suggested to data providers when the descriptive metadata is
                    created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the compilation of a data package and its description with
                    metadata is complete, the curator can choose between two options:
                    archiving or publication of the research data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Archiving</b> allows the optional description of the data package
                    with descriptive metadata. Normally, neither data nor metadata are made
                    publicly accessible, but this can be changed by the curator
                    independently by granting appropriate rights via the online system. In
                    this case, the data is not assigned a Persistent Identifier. The curator
                    must determine the desired retention period.]{.T3}
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the <b>publication</b> of a data package, its valid
                    description in the form of descriptive metadata and the granting of a
                    license by the data provider are required. In principle, metadata and
                    data are publicly searchable and accessible. For the data, the data
                    provider can optionally determine an embargo period during which only
                    the metadata are publicly searchable and accessible. After the embargo
                    period has expired, the data automatically becomes publicly accessible.
                    RADAR4KIT assigns a Persistent Identifier (here: Digital Object
                    Identifier, in short DOI) for each published data package and registers
                    it with DataCite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the publication of a data package, its valid description in the
                    form of descriptive metadata and the granting of a license by the data
                    provider are required. Basically, metadata and data are publicly
                    searchable and accessible. For the data, the data provider can
                    optionally determine an embargo period during which only the metadata
                    are publicly searchable and accessible. After the embargo period has
                    expired, the data automatically becomes publicly accessible. RADAR4KIT
                    assigns a Persistent Identifier (here: Digital Object Identifier, in
                    short DOI) for each published data package and registers it with
                    DataCite. With this DOI the published data package is persistently
                    identifiable, citable and can be linked to a conventional scientific
                    publication, e.g. at KITopen. At the same time, the descriptive metadata
                    are transferred to DataCite. The data provider must license it under
                    Creative Commons Zero (CC0) 1.0 Universal. For the transfer, the
                    descriptive metadata is automatically converted from RADAR format to
                    DataCite format. Furthermore, the descriptive metadata in both RADAR and
                    DublinCore format will be publicly offered for harvesting via an OAI
                    provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For published and archived data packages a license must be selected
                    from a predefined list of recommended licenses. The list includes all
                    Creative Commons 4.0 International licenses (including CC0 1.0
                    Universal), an \"All rights reserved\" license and the option to specify
                    a proprietary license. The operator reserves the right to add further
                    licenses to the list.
                </p>

                <h2>Temporary storage</h2>

                <p>
                    For the compilation and description of data packages, the operator
                    provides so-called temporary storage. If the total available temporary
                    storage is full, no further data can be added by the authorized data
                    providers until files are deleted, data packages are archived or
                    published or the temporary storage is increased. In the case of
                    archiving or publication, the data packages move from temporary storage
                    to permanent storage. These data packages then no longer occupy any
                    space in temporary storage. RADAR4KIT restricts the use of temporary
                    storage for a limited time. The maximum usage time of the temporary
                    storage is checked per data packet. Data packets can be left in
                    temporary storage for a maximum of six months. After this period, they
                    must either be archived, published or deleted. One month before the end
                    of the storage period, RADAR4KIT sends an e-mail to the data provider,
                    informing them that the storage period is about to end. Every week,
                    RADAR4KIT sends an e-mail reminder to the data submitter with a notice
                    that the retention period is about to end. If the data package has not
                    been deleted, archived or published by the data provider after six
                    months, RADAR4KIT will delete the data package.
                </p>
                <h2>Quotas</h2>
                <p>
                    In RADAR4KIT the maximum usable size of temporary storage, permanent
                    storage used for archived data packets and permanent storage used for
                    published data packets is limited. The amount of storage available per
                    employee for the individual categories is regulated in the
                    <a href='http://www.scc.kit.edu/dienste/it-grundausstattung.php'>basic IT contingent</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Holding periods and immutability of data packages</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT enables the permanent and unaltered storage of data packets
                    for a defined period of time ("<b>retention period</b>"). For archived data
                    packages, the data provider specifies a retention period. The actual
                    retention period for archived data packets may be shorter if the
                    RADAR4KIT service is discontinued before the end of the retention
                    period. There is no need to select a retention period for published data
                    packets, it is in principle unlimited. The KIT guarantees an actual
                    retention period of at least 10 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the retention period, RADAR4KIT does not modify the stored data
                    packets, but only ensures their physical preservation ("<b>bitstream
                        preservation</b>"). Accordingly, RADAR4KIT does not guarantee the long-term
                    usability or interpretability of the data contained in a data packet, as
                    this depends on the availability of the data formats selected by the
                    data provider and the corresponding programs for interpreting
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data packets in permanent memory cannot be changed. Deletions can be
                    carried out by the administrator in justified exceptional cases after
                    consultation with the operator. Justified exceptional cases include, for
                    example, legal violations or incorrect data. In case of a deletion only
                    the data is deleted, but not the metadata. These contain an indication
                    that the data has been deleted.
                </p>
                <h2>Assessment of research data</h2>
                <p>
                    RADAR4KIT supports a review process before data publication. For this
                    purpose a data package can be set to the status "in review" before
                    publication. In this state the data package is no longer editable.
                    RADAR4KIT generates a unique link that the data provider can pass on to
                    the responsible publisher or reviewers. This link allows access to the
                    not yet published data package without prior authentication. After
                    completion of the review process, the data submitter can either return
                    the status for the work package to edit mode or publish the data
                    package. In both cases, the generated unique link becomes invalid, so
                    that reviewers can no longer access the data package. The data provider
                    can set a data package to the status "in review" several times in
                    succession.

                    Beyond that, the operator does not perform any further quality
                    assurance of the content of the posted research data. The data providers
                    themselves are responsible for this.

                <h2>Technical and organizational measures for data security</h2>
                <p>
                    Data in the temporary storage is located on magnetic disks, which are
                    protected against data loss due to failure of individual disks via a
                    RAID6 array. In addition, the stored data is incrementally written to
                    tape once a day as a backup. The backup is done at file level and is
                    kept for two generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archived and published data packages are stored on magnetic tapes in
                    so-called tape libraries. RADAR4KIT stores all data packages moved to
                    permanent storage in two copies at different locations on different
                    tapes. The storage is done at the Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC)
                    of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) at two locations. Data
                    packets are provided with a checksum before storage, which is
                    automatically checked after each copying process. This enables errors
                    during data transmission to be detected and eliminated ("end-to-end
                    checksum"). When a data packet is accessed, the checksum is calculated
                    again and compared with the stored value to identify any data
                    consistency errors. If, exceptionally, an error is detected, RADAR4KIT
                    accesses the second copy of the data packet. Regular checks of the
                    copies for possible bit errors ("fixity checks") are currently not
                    performed. The SCC always keeps its respective storage infrastructures
                    up to date. As a result, all data is migrated to new data carriers
                    within a period of about five to eight years. With each read operation
                    and at the latest during this data migration, a check for bit errors is
                    performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data packages intended for archiving or publication are transferred
                    to permanent storage before being transferred to the permanent storage
                    in a structure corresponding to the
                    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493">BagIt specifications</a>. This structure contains not
                    only the actual research data
                    in its original arrangement with all files and directories but also
                    technical and descriptive metadata as well as a manifest corresponding
                    to the specification. The BagIt structure is summarized in a TAR file
                    and stored as an Archive Information Package (AIS) according to the OAIS
                    standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accesses to the temporary storage are synchronous, i.e. the delivery of
                    the requested data starts without any noticeable delay. Accesses to the
                    permanent tape storage are asynchronous, i.e. in some cases several
                    minutes may pass between request and delivery. In times of high access
                    rates, the waiting time can exceptionally be in the hourly range.
                    Frequently accessed data packets, even if they are already stored in
                    permanent memory, are regularly delivered quickly (i.e. synchronously)
                    via a cache. An assurance of fast delivery from the permanent memory
                    cannot be given.

                <h2>Assignment of access rights and embargoes</h2>
                <p>
                    Data packages that have not yet been archived or published, i.e. are in
                    the processing state, can only be viewed by the data providers and
                    administrators. There is an exception for reviewers (see section
                    "Review of research data"). A curator can grant the right to act as a
                    data provider (curator or subcurator) to other users registered with
                    RADAR4KIT at any time in their own workspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archived data packages are normally only accessible to data
                    providers and the administrator. The data provider can grant other users
                    registered with RADAR4KIT the right to view the descriptive metadata and
                    retrieve the archived data packages. If desired, he can also make the
                    archived data set publicly accessible. These rights assignments can be
                    changed by the data provider at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archived data (unless the data provider has made it publicly accessible
                    in whole or in part) cannot be found either via search or via OAI. Third
                    parties can neither view nor research the data or the metadata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Published data packages</b> as well as archived data packages for
                    which the data provider has set the access rights in such a way that
                    they are accessible to the public without restriction can be retrieved
                    by all data users who are registered with RADAR4KIT and anonymous (not
                    registered) data users. The descriptive metadata is searchable in the
                    web interface and is additionally offered for harvesting via an OAI
                    provider. Furthermore, they are publicly accessible at
                    <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">www.datacite.org</a>.
                    This also applies if the actual research data is still under embargo.
                    The data provider can set up an embargo period of up to 12 months after
                    publication for the actual research data, during which only the metadata
                    is searchable and retrievable, but not the research data. After the
                    embargo period has expired, the research data will also be generally
                    accessible.
